## 🔐 Security & Economy

Gift Phase V2 implements strict security measures to protect the ecosystem:
- **Server-Side Increments:** All balance updates (DUCK/TON) are handled via Firestore `increment()` to prevent client-side manipulation.
- **Timestamp Verification:** Task resets and cooldowns are calculated using server-side timestamps.
- **Custom Modals:** All critical actions (Bidding, Purchasing, Reseting) use a custom 3D Modal system instead of native browser dialogs for a secure and consistent UI.
